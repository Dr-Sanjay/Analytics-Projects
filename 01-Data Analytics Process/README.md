# Data Analytics Process
Application in Real Life Scenario Case Study / PPT  
Difficulty Level:       
Description:  
We use Data Analytics in everyday life without even knowing it.  
For eg : Going to a market to buy something .  

Plan  
We first decide which things I need before going to market . Is it a shirt , jeans , footwear etc.
Prepare  
Next I need to check how much I am willing to spend and how to get that money.
Process  
Then I need to check how much I want from the data. Like if I am going to buy footwear what do I want - slippers / shoes / sandals etc.
Analyze  
You obviously won't buy things which are out of trend, Also you need to check does the jeans which you have and the color of t-shirt you want to buy, will it make a good combination.  
Share
Now you communicate your idea to the shopkeeper to find the best suitable fit for you.
Act
Then you finally buy it!  
Your Task:  
Your task is to give the example(s) of such a real-life situation where we use Data Analytics and link it with the data analytics process. You can prepare a PPT/PDF on a real-life scenario explaining it with the above process (Plan, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act) and submit it as part of this task.
